## Background

The player in *Age of Savagery* is given a piece of land and is prompted by the game's storyline to build a complex of buildings somewhere in the land to form their 'inner city' to satisfy the needs of the game's storyline. *Age of Savagery* entails fighting for land, establishing cities and fortresses.

In the flow of such games, 

- In the inner city (your own small city), players must **gather resources**, **amass manpower**, **consume** low-level resources **to produce** high-level resources, **build up** and **defend** the city, as well as **attract/train** a variety of human resources, **upgrade** skills for manpower, **upgrade** skills for buildings, etc. depending on the environment. You must employ tools that can speed up time if you don't want to wait because doing these things, such as building structures and improving your character's talents, requires both resources and time.
- On the periphery (the large map), players can **loot the cities**, **resources**, and **land of other players** and keep expanding their own territory.

The data contains a wide range of features, including accessible resources (which can also be used), levels, props, skills, etc.

## The Goal

This competition predicted customers' 45-day payments based on their first seven days of game play.
